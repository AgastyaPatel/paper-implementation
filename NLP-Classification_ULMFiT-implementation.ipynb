    "- To use finetuning of pretrained LM trained on large corpus of text and fine tune it to our selective domain of texts\n",
    "- This helps model to understand the text in our target domain more easier which can be used to fine tune again to achieve our final goal\n",
    "- Final goal may be text classification - Sentimental Analysis, Author Identification, Court discoveries etc.\n",

    "## Dataset Used\n",
    "- IMDb Review Dataset containing few thousands of movie reviews\n",
    "- Contains 25k Training and 25k for testing.\n",
    "- Contains seperate folder for negative and positive reviews in each training and testing folders."
